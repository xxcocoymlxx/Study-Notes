-- of them so that they are *total* (always terminate and don't raise
-- and error), and compile with the given type signatures.

-- Feel free to change the function and parameter names to be more descriptive!


-- Note that (_, _) is the Haskell *tuple* type, which is also generically polymorphic.

--f2 takes 3 arguments, 2 functions and returns c
--note: myFunc2's return value is muFunc1's imput
