# On 142.1.200.148 , not on the lab systems!!!!!

# 1) Remember, you have a collection of ports from a2, you need to use
#    two of them, call them p1 and p2
# 2) setup the application by 
npm init
npm install --save express
npm install --save ws
npm install --save JSON

# 3) Put p1 in express-static
# 4) Put p2 in echoServerSimple.js and in echoClient.html, make sure the 
#    URL inside echoClient.html is correct, you are connecting to 142.1.200.148.
# 5) Explain why you did this?
# 6) Run express-static and echoServerSimple (both at the same time)

nodejs express-static.js & # run this one in the background
nodejs echoServerSimple.js

# 7) Bring up a browser and visit http://142.1.200.148:p1/echoClient.html
# 8) Play with this a bit. Try with two browsers.
# 9) Fix scribble.html (HINT: it needs the correct port)
# 9) Now fix echoServerBroadcast so that it works (you will need to unsort it)
#    if you dont have time, just use .original
# 10) Now try running just ...

nodejs express-static.js & # run this one in the background
nodejs echoServerBroadcast.js

# 11) Run scribble.html in your browser, open a few windows.
# 12) Modify both echoServerBroadcast.js and scribble.js so that each
#     connection has its own colour.
