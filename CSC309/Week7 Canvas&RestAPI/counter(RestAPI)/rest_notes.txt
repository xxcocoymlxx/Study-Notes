REST Web Services
Representational State Transfer

---------------------------------------------------------
Rest is an architecture, a way of organizing
your application to work closely with the HTTP protocol.

A Restful architecture is Stateless, Client-Server, Layered,
supporting caching. 

Designing an application in this way takes advantage of the web
architecture to naturally make your application more scalable.

Def: Stateless - URI provides enough information to carry out
     request. This helps with scalability (lowers requirements
     on server).

Def: Client-Server - so can separate concerns, ie data from 
     application


Def: Layered - client may not be directly connected to 
     resource but can take advantage of this (ie cache, 
     load balancing)

---------------------------------------------------------
Properties of HTTP requests

Def: Idempotent - repeat request, get same result
      http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/idempotency.html

Def: Safe - no side effects

Def: Cachable - enables caching in client, along the way,
     to scale application
