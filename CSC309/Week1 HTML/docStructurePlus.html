<!-- This alerts the reader of the document (typically the browser) of the specific type of
HTML document to follow. There are a few different HTML standards. The <!DOCTYPE html> 
directive tells the browser that the remainder of the document conforms to the 
HTML5 standard Document Type Definition. Lets back up a second. HTML documents 
are (now) actually XML documents that conform to particular, well known 
Document Type Definitions. 

There are a few options for 'html' documents
Basically the difference between these is the set of tags
the browser is willing to accept in a valid document. By accept I mean, 
understands and can properly render as the author would hope. Operationally, 
when the browser sees the directive, it could select a particular rendering 
engine to read the rest of the document.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Document Title</title>
		<!-- command + "/" to auto-comment -->

		<!-- This element is most commonly used to link to stylesheets (aka. CSS),
			the CSS style is defined in the external stylesheet.

		The rel stands for "relationship", and is probably one of the key features of the <link> element-->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

		If you want to run the same JavaScript on several pages in a web site, you should create an external JavaScript file, instead of writing the same script over and over again. Save the script file with a .js extension, and then refer to it using the src attribute in the <script> tag. -->
