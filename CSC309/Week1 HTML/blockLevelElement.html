		A Block level element is one that occupies the width of its container.
		View the page source to see how it's done.
		Examples below are from Netscape.

		<hr/><!--a horizontal rule, a horizontal line-->
		<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->

		<h3>Headings Example</h3>

		<!-- attribute within the start tag, add a border around the heading-->
		<H1 style="border: 1px solid black;" >

		<H2>Heading 2</H2> 
		<H3>Heading 3</H3>
		<H4>Heading 4</H4>

		<h3>Blockquote Example</h3>
		<!-- The <blockquote> tag specifies a section that is quoted from another source. Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements. -->
		<P>Here is an extract from a press release about Netscape Netcaster. </P>

		<!-- Note: <P> doesn't have indent, <blockquote> has indent. -->
		<blockquote>
			On August 13 1997, Netscape Communications announced the
			availability of Netscape Netcaster push client software as part of
			Netscape Communicator. Netscape Netcaster is the first push software
			based on open Internet standards, such as HTML, Java and JavaScript,
			allowing virtually any Web site to become a "channel"
			that delivers up-to-date information directly to the desktop.
		</blockquote>
	
		<blockquote>
			Bob Lisbonne, vice president of client product marketing at Netscape said:
			<!-- nested <blockquote>, nested indent -->
			<blockquote>
				"Networked enterprises can begin to deploy Webtops as
				consistent corporate computing interfaces that span
				all platforms and can be updated dynamically."
			</blockquote>

		<!-- The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
		The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements to style them with CSS or to perform certain tasks with JavaScript. -->
		<div align="right">
			<!-- This section will then align right. Paragraphs outside of this <div> will NOT align right. -->
			<h3>Aligning a Block of Content to the Right (the old way)</h3>
			<P>You can use a DIV tag to align a block of content to the right.</P>
			<P>The content can include anything you like, including tables, images, lists, 
			and so on. Note, however, that right-aligned lists often do not look very 
			neat.</P>
			<b>Note:</b> The way it is done here is deprecated in HTML4 and not supported in HTML5
		</div>


		<div style="border:1px solid black; text-align:right;">
			<h3>Aligning a Block of Content to the Right (the new, HTML5 way)</h3>
			<P>You can use a DIV tag to align a block of content to the right.</P>
			<P>The content can include anything you like, including tables, images, lists, 
			and so on. Note, however, that right-aligned lists often do not look very 
			neat.</P>
			<b>Note:</b> The way it is done here is the new, suggested HTML5 way.
		</div>

		<hr/>
		<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->

		<h3>Paragraph Example</h3>
		<P>Use the P tag to display paragraphs. The P element starts on a new line, and is preceded by extra space. 
		<P>You can also use the P tag to insert a line break with extra space. In most, but not all cases, it is OK to omit the closing tag. </P>

		<hr/>

<!-- Text in a pre element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and it preserves both spaces and line breaks. The <pre> tag defines preformatted text. Text in a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks. 适用于在web上展示code -->
		<h3>PRE Example</h3>
		The example below preserves formatting, but the rendering engine will
		look inside and render html elements! Otherwise the rendering engine will ignore whitespace and flow text continuously. 

<!-- 注意接下来这段话的formatting，html没有omit掉space和line break -->

<!-- The <xmp> renders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. 简单来说就是不管你写在<xmp> tag里的东西
是不是code，都会被原模原样展示出来-->
<h3>XMP Example</h3>
<p> An xmp element (not supported in HTML5) displays exactly the text in the element body.
For example: The basic structure of an HTML document is:</p>

<xmp>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Document Title</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		Page Content Goes here!
	</body>
</html>
</xmp>
