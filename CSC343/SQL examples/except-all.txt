-- except-all

-- Once again, to set up the context for these examples, we use SQL commands
-- that have not been covered yet in the course, such as CREATE TABLE
-- and INSERT INTO.  They are a preview of material to come in about a week,
-- but you don't need to understand these commands in any detail yet.
-- The point of these examples is something else: how and when duplicates can
-- exist in a table, and can be returned by a query.

-- Punchline for this example:
-- The ALL in "EXCEPT ALL" determines not only how many times a tuple occurs
-- but whether or not it occurs at all!

-- Setup:

csc343h-dianeh=> create table P (a int, b int);
csc343h-dianeh=> create table Q (a int, c int);
csc343h-dianeh=> insert into P values 
csc343h-dianeh-> (1, 151), (2, 123), (3, 432), (1, 333), (1, 345), 
csc343h-dianeh-> (4, 912), (5, 123);
csc343h-dianeh=> insert into Q values 
csc343h-dianeh-> (1, 44), (3, 88), (3, 12), (9, 12);

csc343h-dianeh=> select * from P;
 a |  b  
---+-----
 1 | 151
 2 | 123
 3 | 432
 1 | 333
 1 | 345
 4 | 912
 5 | 123
(7 rows)

csc343h-dianeh=> select * from Q;
 a | c  
---+----
 1 | 44
 3 | 88
 3 | 12
 9 | 12
(4 rows)

-- With EXCEPT, a single occurence of a value for a in Q wipes out 
-- all occurences of it from P.  In this case, every 1 value in P
-- is removed as a result of a single 1 value in Q.

csc343h-dianeh=> (select a from P) except (select a from Q);
 a 
---
 2
 4                <-- There are no 1s anywhere in this result
 5
(3 rows)

-- But with EXCEPT ALL, we match them up one for one.
-- (And the same diagram and matching can be used to predict the
-- results in whichever direction we are subtracting)
-- Now some of the 1 values are left behind after the set difference.

csc343h-dianeh=> (select a from P) except all (select a from Q);
 a 
---
 1                <-- There are two 1s in this result
 1
 2
 4
 5
(5 rows)

-- Checking the two kinds of set difference in the other direction now.

csc343h-dianeh=> (select a from Q) except (select a from P);
 a 
---
 9
(1 row)

csc343h-dianeh=> (select a from Q) except all (select a from P);
 a 
---
 3
 9
(2 rows)
