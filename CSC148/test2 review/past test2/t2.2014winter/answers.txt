1. Yes.

The empty tree has a sorted inorder traversal. Now, assume t is not the empty tree. t's left child has a sorted inorder traversal whose maximum element is <= root; t's right child has a sorted inorder traversal whose minimum element is >= root. So, the left inorder + root + right inorder is a sorted list.
