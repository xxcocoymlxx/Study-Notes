Explain what has_key2 does instead and when will it return True and when will it return False?

Your discussion of has_key2 here:

【has_key2】 
has_key2 returns True/False directly based on results of only one branch (right, centre or left), also it puts its base case ‘if s == "$"’ at the top, so it returns True when it is an empty string, but base case should be checked when it has reached its innermost recursion, where s == "$" means it is already the end of the string.
1.returns True when it is an empty string. 
2.returns True when the whole string is found.
3.returns True when part of the string (first few letters of the string) is found in the tree.
4.returns False when last few letters of a string is asked whether of not are in the tree.


【has_key】
The variable ‘found’ is re-assigned in every layer of recursion, it only returns true when every layer of recursion returns True meaning that the whole string is found in the tree.
1.only returns true when the whole string is fount in the tree.
2.returns False when it is an empty string.
